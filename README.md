# Python Programming Exercises

This repository contains a collection of various exercises that I find interesting during my journey of learning the Python programming language. Many of these exercises are focused not only on syntax but also on developing algorithmic thinking skills.

- Quizz : tasks from the course "Algorithmique et Programmation" attended as a part of the TAL programm at Nanterre university 
- Sololearn : tasks from different websites such as SoloLearn and CodeWars
- Different : scripts and parts of code which might be useful for future projects
